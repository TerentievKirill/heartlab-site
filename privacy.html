    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 2025-11-20</p>

    <p>
      Hi 👋 I'm a one-person studio, and this is the privacy policy written by an actual human — me. 
      I build Heartlab apps with care, caffeine, and a strong belief that software should feel gentle, not creepy. 
      So let's talk about privacy — the fun way (yes, it’s possible).
    </p>

    <h2>1. What I collect (spoiler: almost nothing)</h2>
    <p>
      I try to collect as little data as humanly possible. I make emotional apps, not surveillance systems.
      Depending on the app, I may collect:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Basic technical info</strong> (app version, device type, crash logs) — so the app doesn't explode unexpectedly.</li>
      <li><strong>Push notification tokens</strong> — so your phone knows it's you when I send a soft little "hey 💌".</li>
      <li><strong>Whatever you intentionally type into the app</strong> (like notes or favorites). This stays on your device unless the app explicitly tells you otherwise.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. What I absolutely do NOT collect</h2>
    <p>
      I don't collect:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>your name;</li>
      <li>your location;</li>
      <li>your contacts;</li>
      <li>what you're overthinking right now;</li>
      <li>who you miss (even though the app may suspect it 👀).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In short — I don’t know who you are, and that’s exactly how it should be.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Third‑party services (the boring but required part)</h2>
    <p>
      Some apps use privacy‑friendly third‑party tools like:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>OneSignal</strong> or <strong>Firebase</strong> — for push notifications;</li>
      <li><strong>Crash reporting tools</strong> — to understand why something decided to break at 3 AM.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These services collect anonymous technical stuff. Not your secrets, not your diary, not your heartbreak timeline.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Security</h2>
    <p>
      I do my best to keep your data safe. But let's be honest:
      no system in the world is 100% secure — even NASA gets hacked.
      So while I take care, I can't promise magical invincibility.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Your choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Want zero data collection? Disable analytics (if the app has that toggle).</li>
      <li>Don't want notifications? Turn them off — the app won’t get offended.</li>
      <li>Want a nuclear‑level reset? Uninstalling deletes everything on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>
      My apps are not designed for kids under 13.
      If you're under 13 and reading this… I'm genuinely impressed. But also: I don't collect your data.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes</h2>
    <p>
      If I update this policy, the date at the top will change. Major updates may also appear inside the app.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you have questions, feedback, or just want to say hi:
      <br />📧 <strong>hello@heartlab.app</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>9. Bonus level</h2>
    <p>
      If you actually read this entire Privacy Policy (I mean… wow), send me an email with the subject:
      <br /><strong>“I read the Privacy Policy till the end”</strong>
      <br />and I’ll give you <strong>1 month of Heartlab Pro</strong> for free.
      <br />Yes, really. You earned it.
