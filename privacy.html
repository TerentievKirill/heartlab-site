    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 2025-11-20</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Heartlab</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”) 
      collects, uses and protects your information when you use our mobile applications 
      and the website <strong>heartlab.app</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
    <p>We try to collect as little data as possible. Depending on the app, we may collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Basic usage data</strong> (for example, app version, device type, crash logs) — to keep the app stable and improve it.</li>
      <li><strong>Optional analytics</strong> (for example, which screens are opened) — only in aggregated and anonymized form, without identifying a specific person.</li>
      <li><strong>Information you intentionally share inside the app</strong> (for example, notes, tasks or reminders). This data is stored on your device or in our services only to provide the app’s main functionality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How we use your data</h2>
    <p>We may use the collected data to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>provide and maintain the app;</li>
      <li>improve stability and performance;</li>
      <li>understand how people use the app to make it more helpful;</li>
      <li>communicate important changes, updates or issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-party services</h2>
    <p>
      Our apps may use trusted third-party services (for example, analytics or crash reporting tools). 
      These services may collect information according to their own Privacy Policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where possible, we use privacy-friendly settings and avoid collecting data that can directly identify you.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data storage and security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information. 
      However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Your choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You can uninstall the app at any time — this stops all data collection from your device.</li>
      <li>Some apps may include settings to limit analytics or certain data collection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Our apps are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. 
      If you believe that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Policy from time to time. We will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. 
      Significant changes may also be mentioned in the app description or inside the app.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us at:<br/>
