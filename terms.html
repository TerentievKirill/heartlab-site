    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 2025-11-20</p>

    <p>
      Hi 👋 I'm a one-person studio, and these are the Terms — written by me, the actual human who builds Heartlab.
      They're friendly, short, and as painless as possible.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Personal, non-commercial use</h2>
    <p>
      Heartlab apps are made for personal use — to help you stay soft, grounded, and a little more kind to yourself.
      Please don’t resell them, clone them, or do anything wild that turns them into something they aren’t.
    </p>

    <h2>2. No professional advice</h2>
    <p>
      My apps may contain tips, thoughts, or emotional nudges.
      They are <strong>not</strong> medical, psychological, legal, financial, or any other professional advice.
      If you’re facing something serious, please talk to a qualified human — not an app, even a cute one.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Changes to the apps</h2>
    <p>
      I update and improve the apps regularly (sometimes at 3 AM with too much coffee).
      Features may shift, evolve, or disappear.
      I don’t promise any feature will stay forever — but I do promise to keep the apps feeling gentle and useful.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>
      The apps are provided “as is”. I try hard, but I can’t guarantee perfection.
      To the extent the law allows, I’m not responsible for indirect or magical-level damages.
      If the app makes you feel better — great. If it accidentally crashes — I’ll fix it.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-party links</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes the apps may contain links to external services.
      I’m not responsible for what happens once you leave Heartlab’s soft pink universe.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Things you should not do</h2>
    <p>Please don’t:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>reverse-engineer, decompile, or hack the apps,</li>
      <li>use them to harm anyone,</li>
      <li>break the law or someone's heart (the app tries to prevent that 😌).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>But</strong> — if you somehow manage to reverse-engineer or break the app in an impressive way…
      <br />honestly, <strong>welcome to the team</strong>. I admire your skills.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to these Terms</h2>
    <p>
      If I update these Terms, the date at the top will change. Using the apps after that means you accept the updated version.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you have questions, ideas, or just want to say hi:
      <br />📧 <strong>hello@heartlab.app</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>9. Secret bonus</h2>
    <p>
      If you actually read these Terms all the way to the end (you absolute legend),
      send me an email with the subject:
      <br /><strong>“I read the Terms till the end”</strong>.
      <br />I’ll give you <strong>1 month of Heartlab Pro</strong> for free.
    </p>
